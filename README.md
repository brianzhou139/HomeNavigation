# What the  idea is.

A real-time home mapping app for blind people.

###### To Recognize objects in the house<br>
Case: If something fell on the ground, they can’t find it easily. Also, they may forget the location of their belongings (the keys or example).<br>
A custom image classification model trained with AutoML Vision Edge will identify most of the objects that can be found in a house.

###### To Recognize people and faces they interact with at home<br>
Case: when a visually impaired person enters a room they don’t know who is inside
and they have to wait for the other people to greet and identify themselves which is really frustrating.<br>
A sighted user provides photos to the app and a name for each Object/face to associate ,and a deep learning system will identify faces each they appear again.

The app will be  called via speech from Google assistant  tools to make it easier  for the blind to access its functionalities
